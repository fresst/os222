# Links (that might be useful)
1. [What Operating System Is](https://www.guru99.com/operating-system-tutorial.html)<br>
It explains what operating system actually is, its history and how it works.
  
2. [Operating System - Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_overview.htm)<br>
A much briefer explanation about OS compared to the link above.
  
3. [The Linux Commands Handbook (pdf)](https://bjpcjp.github.io/pdfs/devops/linux-commands-handbook.pdf)<br>
Additional source for learning linux command. Its content are generally the same as the resource provided in [https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/W01-02.html](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/W01-02.html#:~:text=Basic%20Linux%20Commands)

4. [What is Cybersecurity?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity)<br>
This article from IBM provides a concise yet thorough explanation about cybersecurity. Completely unrelated, but I didn't know IBM has a bunch of articles. The resources below also provide reports on several cybersecurity reports (conducted by IBM themselves) and other articles.

5. [What Is Digital Privacyâ€”and How Can It Be Protected?](https://www.idx.us/knowledge-center/what-is-digital-privacy-and-how-can-it-be-protected)<br>
IDX showcases several dangerous (yet familiar in our daily lives..) threats on digital privacy.
Although not very detailed, they also wrote how (certain state) laws are protecting digital privacy, which I think is very fascinating.

6. [Internet privacy laws revealed - how your personal information is protected online](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/how-your-personal-information-is-protected-online#:~:text=Electronic%20Communications%20Privacy%20Act%20(ECPA,access%2C%20use%2C%20and%20disclosure.)<br>
I searched more on how federal and state laws (very US-centric, sadly) affect and protect online privacy. A good read.
Also one point from this article that stuck to me was how our miscellaneous digital footprint gave so much information.
