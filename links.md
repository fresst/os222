Additional source for learning linux command. Its content are generally the same as the resource provided in [https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/W01-02.html](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/W01-02.html#:~:text=Basic%20Linux%20Commands)

4. [What is Cybersecurity?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity)<br>
This article from IBM provides a concise yet thorough explanation about cybersecurity. Completely unrelated, but I didn't know IBM has a bunch of articles. The resources below also provide reports on several cybersecurity reports (conducted by IBM themselves) and other articles.

5. [What Is Digital Privacyâ€”and How Can It Be Protected?](https://www.idx.us/knowledge-center/what-is-digital-privacy-and-how-can-it-be-protected)<br>
IDX showcases several dangerous (yet familiar in our daily lives..) threats on digital privacy.
Although not very detailed, they also wrote how (certain state) laws are protecting digital privacy, which I think is very fascinating.

6. [Internet privacy laws revealed](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/how-your-personal-information-is-protected-online)<br>
I searched more on how federal and state laws (very US-centric, sadly) affect and protect online privacy. A good read.
Also one point from this article that stuck to me was how our miscellaneous digital footprint gave so much information.

7. [File System Interface in Operating System](https://www.w3schools.in/operating-system/file-system-interface)<br>
I got tired reading Silberschatz, and then I came across this article. 
W3schools gave a very straight forward and easy-to-follow introduction to File System Interface. They also cover other OS topics.

8. [Allocation Methods](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-linked-list-allocation)<br>
I had a hard time understanding file allocation, especially linked list. 
javaTpoint gave a complete explanation on all allocation methods in several short articles.
